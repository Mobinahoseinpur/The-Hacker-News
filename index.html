                                        SaaS-to-SaaS connections, will inherit

                                        translates to a serious security risk as
                                        most indie AI tools follow lax security
                                        standards. Threat actors target indie AI
                                        tools as the means to access the
                                        connected SaaS systems that contain the
                                        company's crown jewels.

                                        this backdoor to your organization's
                                        SaaS estate, they can access and

                                        We start with the basics for a reason.
                                        Ensure someone on your team, or a member
                                        of Legal, reads the terms of services
                                        for any AI tools that employees request.
                                        Of course, this isn't necessarily a
                                        safeguard against data breaches or
                                        leaks, and indie vendors may stretch the
                                        truth in hopes of placating enterprise
                                        customers. But thoroughly understanding
                                        the terms will inform your legal
                                        strategy if AI vendors break service
                                        terms.

                                        An application policy provides clear
                                        guidelines and transparency to your
                                        organization. A simple "allow-list" can
                                        cover AI tools built by enterprise SaaS
                                        providers, and anything not included
                                        falls into the "disallowed" camp.
                                        Alternatively, you can establish a data
                                        policy that dictates what types of data
                                        employees can feed into AI tools. For
                                        example, you can forbid inputting any
                                        form of intellectual property into AI
                                        programs, or sharing data between your

                                            were inserted into them? What impact

                                            users, or other objects?

                                            with the potential for traditional
                                            vulnerabilities to occur (such as

                                            above)? For example, is the prompt

                                            be possible? Does web fetching

                                        more willing to partner with you on the
                                        appropriate AI tool than go rogue with
                                        an indie AI vendor.
